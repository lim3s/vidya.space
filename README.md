# Vidya.Space
The files stored at http://vidya.space/

## Directory Structure
The root directory is reserved, don't try to change it.
Subdomains are represented by a directory. So memes.vidya.space would be stored in /memes/

## Rules
I will accept any pull requests that follow these rules:
- Nothing illegal
- No copyrighted content
- No malicious code

## DNS Subdomains
If you want to have the DNS point a subdomain to something else, create a README.md inside the subdomain containing details of your desired A or CNAME record. See /mc or /ts for an example
